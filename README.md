# AI-for-Smart-City-Development
To create a Python script that automates the job posting and management process for the AI Developer position specializing in computer vision and pattern recognition, hereâ€™s how we can approach it. The script can include the following functionality:

    Posting the job details.
    Sending emails to candidates who apply for the job.
    Allowing candidates to submit their applications via email.

Below is a Python script to achieve this:

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

class JobPosting:
    def __init__(self, title, company, description, responsibilities, qualifications, contact_email):
        self.title = title
        self.company = company
        self.description = description
        self.responsibilities = responsibilities
        self.qualifications = qualifications
        self.contact_email = contact_email

    def create_job_posting(self):
        """Generates the job posting as a formatted string"""
        job_posting = f"""
        Job Title: {self.title}
        Company: {self.company}
        
        {self.description}
        
        Responsibilities:
        {self.responsibilities}
        
        Qualifications:
        {self.qualifications}
        
        To Apply:
        Please send your resume and cover letter to {self.contact_email}.
        """
        return job_posting

    def send_email_notification(self, recipient_email, job_posting):
        """Sends the job posting to the applicant or interested parties"""
        sender_email = "your_email@example.com"  # Use your company email
        password = "your_email_password"  # Replace with your email password
        subject = f"Job Opportunity: {self.title} at {self.company}"

        msg = MIMEMultipart()
        msg['From'] = sender_email
        msg['To'] = recipient_email
        msg['Subject'] = subject

        # Attach the job posting content as plain text
        msg.attach(MIMEText(job_posting, 'plain'))

        try:
            # Establish connection with the SMTP server
            with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587) as server:  # Use SMTP settings for your email provider
                server.starttls()  # Secure the connection
                server.login(sender_email, password)
                text = msg.as_string()
                server.sendmail(sender_email, recipient_email, text)
                print(f"Job posting successfully sent to {recipient_email}.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error sending email: {e}")

Explanation of the Code:

    JobPosting Class:
        The class holds the job title, company name, description, responsibilities, qualifications, and the contact email.
        It includes methods to:
            create_job_posting: Formats the job description into a readable string.
            send_email_notification: Sends the formatted job posting to an applicant via email.

    Job Details:
        The job_title, company_name, job_description, job_responsibilities, and job_qualifications variables define the job posting.
        The contact_email is where applicants can send their resumes.

    Sending Email:
        The send_email_notification method uses Python's smtplib to send emails. It constructs an email with the job posting and sends it to the recipient email.
        SMTP settings (smtp.example.com, sender email, and password) need to be replaced with actual values to make it functional.

    Job Posting Content:
        The create_job_posting method returns a string of the formatted job details.
        The generated posting can be displayed in the console or sent to candidates.

Benefits:

    Automation: The script automates the process of job posting and email notifications, which is efficient for large-scale recruitment.
    Flexibility: The job description can be updated easily by modifying the relevant variables in the script.
    Customizable: You can integrate this script into a larger recruitment system, with options to manage multiple job postings and handle candidate applications.

Next Steps:

    Replace placeholders such as your_email@example.com, your_email_password, and smtp.example.com with actual email details and SMTP configuration.
    You can extend this script to manage job applications, including tracking submissions and automating interview scheduling.
